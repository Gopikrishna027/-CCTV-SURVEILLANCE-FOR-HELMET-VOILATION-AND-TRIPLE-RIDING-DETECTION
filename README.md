Violations in traffic laws are very common in a highly populated country like India. The accidents 
associated with these violations cause a huge loss to life and property. Since utilization of bikes is high, 
mishaps associated with bikes are additionally high contrasted with different vehicles. One of the main 
causes of these is not using motorcycle helmets. So we propose an approach called “TRAFFIC 
VIOLATION PROCTORING SYSTEM:HELMET AND TRIPLE RIDING DETECTION “using deep 
learning which automatically sends challan or send an SMS for individuals in case of identification of 
bicycle riders without headgear and who are triple riding utilizing surveillance videos in real-time. The 
proposed approach initially recognizes motorcycle riders utilizing background subtraction and object 
segmentation. At that point we utilize object classifier to classify violators. Since wearing helmet is 
critical while driving, our main aim is to decrease the danger of injuries in case of accident. By 
detecting the motorcyclists without helmets, triple riding or other violations we can therefore increase 
their safety while on road. Hence by automating we reduce the workload on the traffic control team 
and will be able to share the evidence with the team efficiently to impose fines on violators.
